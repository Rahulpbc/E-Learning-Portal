	<p>In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number x is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base b, must be raised, to produce that number x.
	In the simplest case the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e.g.,
	since 1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 103, the "logarithm to base 10" of 1000 is 3. The logarithm of x to base b is denoted as logb (x) (or, without parentheses, as logb x, or even without explicit base as log x, when no confusion is possible).
	More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm for any two positive real numbers b and x where b is not equal to 1, is always a unique real number y.
	More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:
{\displaystyle \log _{b}(x)=y\quad } {\displaystyle \log _{b}(x)=y\quad } exactly if {\displaystyle \quad b^{y}=x.} {\displaystyle \quad b^{y}=x.}</p>
<br>
<p>For example, log2 64 = 6, as 64 = 26.
The logarithm to base 10 (that is b = 10) is called the common logarithm and has many applications in science and engineering. 
The natural logarithm has the number e (that is b ≈ 2.718) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and physics, because of its simpler derivative.
 The binary logarithm uses base 2 (that is b = 2) and is commonly used in computer science.
Logarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations.
 They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, and others to perform computations more easily, using slide rules and logarithm tables.</p> 
 <br>
<p> Tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition because of the fact—important in its own right—that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:
{\displaystyle \log _{b}(xy)=\log _{b}x+\log _{b}y,\,} {\displaystyle \log _{b}(xy)=\log _{b}x+\log _{b}y,\,}
provided that b, x and y are all positive and b ≠ 1. The present-day notion of logarithms comes from Leonhard Euler, who connected them to the exponential function in the 18th century.
Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the decibel (dB) is a unit used to express log-ratios, mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which sound pressure is a common example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements of the complexity of algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. 
They help describing frequency ratios of musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers or approximating factorials, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.
In the same way as the logarithm reverses exponentiation, the complex logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function applied to complex numbers.
 The discrete logarithm is another variant; it has uses in public-key cryptography.</p>

 <p>Motivation and definition
Addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are three fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, can be undone by subtraction: adding, say, 2 to 3 gives 5. The process of adding 2 can be undone by subtracting 2: 5 − 2 = 3. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, can be undone by division: doubling a number x, i.e., multiplying x by 2, the result is 2x. To get back x, it is necessary to divide by 2. For example {\displaystyle 2\cdot 3=6} {\displaystyle 2\cdot 3=6} and the process of multiplying by 2 is undone by dividing by 2: {\displaystyle 6/2=3} {\displaystyle 6/2=3}. The idea and purpose of logarithms is also to undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, namely raising a number to a certain power, an operation also known as exponentiation.
 For example, raising 2 to the third power of 2 yields 8, because 8 is the product of three factors of 2:
{\displaystyle 2^{3}=2\times 2\times 2=8} {\displaystyle 2^{3}=2\times 2\times 2=8}
The logarithm (with respect to base 2) of 8 is 3, reflecting the fact that 2 was raised to the third power to get 8.
Exponentiation
This subsection contains a short overview of the exponentiation operation, which is fundamental to understand logarithms. Raising b to the n-th power, where n is a natural number, is done by multiplying n factors equal to b. The n-th power of b is written bn, so that
{\displaystyle b^{n}=\underbrace {b\times b\times \cdots \times b} _{n{\text{ factors}}}} {\displaystyle b^{n}=\underbrace {b\times b\times \cdots \times b} _{n{\text{ factors}}}}
Exponentiation may be extended to by, where b is a positive number and the exponent y is any real number.[1] For example, b−1 is the reciprocal of b, that is, 1/b. Raising b to the power 1/2 is the square root of b. More generally, raising b to a rational power p/q, where p and q are integers, is given by
{\displaystyle b^{p/q}={\sqrt[{q}]{b^{p}}},} {\displaystyle b^{p/q}={\sqrt[{q}]{b^{p}}},}</p>
<br>
<p>the q-th root of bp. Finally, any irrational number (a real number which is not rational) y can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers.
 This can be used to compute the y-th power of b: for example {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\approx 1.414...} {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\approx 1.414...} and {\displaystyle b^{\sqrt {2}}} {\displaystyle b^{\sqrt {2}}} is increasingly well approximated by {\displaystyle b^{1},b^{1.4},b^{1.41},b^{1.414},...} {\displaystyle b^{1},b^{1.4},b^{1.41},b^{1.414},...}. A more detailed explanation, as well as the formula bm + n = bm · bn is contained in the article on exponentiation.
Definition
The logarithm of a positive real number x with respect to base b[nb 1] is the exponent by which b must be raised to yield x. In other words, the logarithm of x to base b is the solution y to the equation[2]
{\displaystyle b^{y}=x.} {\displaystyle b^{y}=x.}
The logarithm is denoted "logb x" (pronounced as "the logarithm of x to base b" or "the base-b logarithm of x" or (most commonly) "the log, base b, of x").
In the equation y = logb x, the value y is the answer to the question "To what power must b be raised, in order to yield x?".</p>
<br>
<p>Examples
log2 16 = 4 , since 24 = 2 ×2 × 2 × 2 = 16.
Logarithms can also be negative: {\displaystyle \quad \log _{2}\!{\frac {1}{2}}=-1\quad } {\displaystyle \quad \log _{2}\!{\frac {1}{2}}=-1\quad } since {\displaystyle \quad 2^{-1}={\frac {1}{2^{1}}}={\frac {1}{2}}.} {\displaystyle \quad 2^{-1}={\frac {1}{2^{1}}}={\frac {1}{2}}.}
log10150 is approximately 2.176, which lies between 2 and 3, just as 150 lies between 102 = 100 and 103 = 1000.
For any base b, logb b = 1 and logb 1 = 0, since b1 = b and b0 = 1, respectively.</p>
